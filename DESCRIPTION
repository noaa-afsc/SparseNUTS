Description: Bayesian inference powered by the sparse no-U-turn (SNUTS) algorithm by 
 Monnahan et al. (in prep). SNUTS is implemented for 'Template Model Builder' ('TMB') models via the 'StanEstimators' interface, which improves sampling efficiency by decorrelating the posterior via a sparse metric prior to sampling. 'AD Model Builder' ('ADMB') models are also supported and have functionality is similar to 'Stan'. The 'rstan' and 'shinystan' packages are used for diagnostics and inference.
