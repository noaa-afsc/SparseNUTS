# Plot marginal distributions for a fitted model

Plot marginal distributions for a fitted model

## Usage

``` r
plot_marginals(
  fit,
  pars = NULL,
  mfrow = NULL,
  add.mle = TRUE,
  add.monitor = TRUE,
  breaks = 30
)
```

## Arguments

- fit:

  A fitted object returned by `sample_admb`.

- pars:

  A numeric or character vector of parameters which to plot, for
  plotting a subset of the total (defaults to all)

- mfrow:

  A custom grid size (vector of two) to be called as `par(mfrow)`,
  overriding the defaults.

- add.mle:

  Whether to add marginal normal distributions determined from the
  inverse Hessian file

- add.monitor:

  Whether to add ESS and Rhat information

- breaks:

  The number of breaks to use in
  [`hist()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/hist.html), defaulting to 30

## Details

This function plots grid cells of all parameters in a model, comparing
the marginal posterior histogram vs the asymptotic normal (red lines)
from the inverse Hessian. Its intended use is to quickly gauge
differences between frequentist and Bayesian inference on the same
model.

If `fit$monitor` exists the effective sample size (ESS) and R-hat
estimates are printed in the top right corner. See
<https://mc-stan.org/rstan/reference/Rhat.html> for more information.
Generally Rhat\>1.05 or ESS\<100 (per chain) suggest inference may be
unreliable.

This function is customized to work with multipage PDFs, specifically:
`pdf('marginals.pdf', onefile=TRUE, width=7,height=5)` produces a nice
readable file.

## Examples

``` r
fit <- readRDS(system.file('examples', 'fit.RDS', package='SparseNUTS'))
#> Warning: cannot open compressed file '', probable reason 'No such file or directory'
#> Error in gzfile(file, "rb"): cannot open the connection
plot_marginals(fit, pars=1:2)
#> Error: object 'fit' not found
```
